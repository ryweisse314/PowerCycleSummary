ORD1- Gens 7 & 10:
- Giant data gap on 10/30/25 for gen7
- Possibly causing complications with 4HRAT readings of previous runs
- On 9/11 4hr temp goes to 0 for gen10

IAD1-B- Gens IAD1- A & B:
- Between 7/10 and 11/17, there isn't a data gap, but the card had no readings in the card.  
- Issue with the PLC, not the MOXA. If we have 16 consecutive data points with no variation, triggers an alarm.

Fannie Mae:
- Problems persisting with comms on GEN 1.
- Had a number of long run events in December, and there are gaps in some of the later run events.
- Bish is going to reset the time on the PLC.
- Only intervals should be in 1 hour or 1 minute.
- This is sending out data around every 21 minutes and 5 seconds.
- There are a few instances of 1 minute gaps.

IAD2-A:
- IP: 10:123:123:113.
- Go back and pull the historical data.
