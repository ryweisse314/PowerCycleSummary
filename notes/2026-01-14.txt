CJ Mushroom:
- There is a single run event for the stack testing.
- Probably missing the beginning of that run since temps start off high.
- Eric may have edited the run by swapping SD cards, and he used a corrupt SD card.
- There are several missing runs because the run signal was not present. The historical shows the runs.
- If a thermocouple or pressure is giving a max or min value, it is an equipment issue and should be reported.

Fannie Mae:
- Comms are still out.

IWCO:
- Missing run events based on the historical graphs.
- Possibly caused by a failed DAC.

Power Cycle:
- HRST Atlantic
- IAD2A Beachwood
