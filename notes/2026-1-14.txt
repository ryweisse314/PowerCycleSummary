sites:
active coms, no run signal: 
- CJ MUshroom- turned their system back on after a year (around may)
	- run events- there is a single run event for the stack testing
	- probably missing the beginning of that run, since temps start off high
	- eric may have edited the run by swapping sd cards, corrupt sd card
	-key point: there are several unaccounted for runs, the run signal is broken. Must check historical for every site. 
	-if a thermocouple or pressure is giving a max or min values, it is an equipment issue. must be reported immediately.
-Fannie Mae
-IWCO- same issue as cj mushroom
	- idea is to check the historical on a weekly basis to ensure that runs are not missed.

What are the characteristics of a failed DAC:
- constant run signal on or off
- measures temp, relay, and pressure
- constant temperature or pressure could also indicate this
- Eric doesn't believe it is a DAC issue for the IWCO site
